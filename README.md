# Micro Blog

A small "blog" based on microservices architectural pattern, event driven architecture and database per service pattern. Built with nodejs, react and kubernetes. Configured with Skafold for develpment.

This app isn't meant to be a actual blog or have the best UX, I created it just to practice microservices and kubernetes, therefore every service use in memory database 
and is doing nothing but receiving a few request and events. And the front-end has the simplest UI and use bootstrap for styling.
